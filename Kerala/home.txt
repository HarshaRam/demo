<p><b>About Kerala India:</b>
Kerala, sometimes referred to in historical terms as Keralam, is 
a state in South India on the Malabar coast. It was created on 1 November 1956 
following the States Reorganisation Act by combining various Malayalam-speaking regions. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), it is bordered by Karnataka to the north and north east, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the thirteenth largest state by population and is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. 
Malayalam is the most widely spoken and official language of the state.

Kerala is the state with the lowest positive population growth rate in India; 
3.44%, highest Human Development Index (HDI); 0.790 in 2011, 
the highest literacy rate; 93.91%, the highest life expectancy; 
77 years and the highest sex ratio; 1,084 women per 1000 men. 
According to a study commissioned by Lien Foundation, 
a Singapore-based philanthropic organisation, Kerala is considered to be the best place to die in India based on the state's provision of palliative care for patients with serious illnesses.[5] The state has witnessed significant emigration of its people, especially to the Gulf states during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. The culture of the state is a synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures,
 developed over millennia, 
under influences from other parts of India and abroad.
