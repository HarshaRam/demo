<p>History of Hyderabad is inextricably linked with the <b>rise and
fall</b> of various kingdoms, <b>Qutb Shahi to Asaf Jahi (Nizams)</b>,
which flourished in the Deccan region during the medieval and modern
times.</p>
<p>It was the famous Qutb Shahi's rule that <b>opened a glorious
chapter</b> in the chronicles of Hyderabad.</p><p></p><p></p><center><img

was the founder of Hyderabad City. In the <b>year 1591</b>,
when the Moon was in the constellation of Leo, Jupiter in its own abode and
all celestial planets favourably placed, he laid the <b>foundation</b>
of a new city which he called Bhagyanagar after his beloved queen
'Bhagmati'. Bhagmati embraced Islam and took the name Hyder Mahal and
consequently Bhagynagar was <b>renamed Hyderabad</b> after her.<p><font

<b>Sultan of Golconda</b>, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was madly <b>in love</b>
with beautiful Hindu courtesan <b>'Bhagmati'</b>, a local dancer. Every
evening, the Prince of Golconda would ride to the village of Chichlam
across Musi river, <b>to meet his beloved</b>, for he couldn't live without
watching her dance, and listening to her soulful voice.<p>Legend has it
that once <b>heavy rains and thunderstorm</b> lashed Golconda and the city
was devastated. Flood water of the Musi river destroyed many homes and
lives. </p><p>Young Sultan of Golconda, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah was worried
for Bhagmati, so he <b>decided to cross the flooded river</b> to meet her.
His Royal guards tried to stop him as it was very dangerous for the young
sultan, but in vain. <b>Prince rode</b> to the shore of the Musi river.
<b>He coerced</b>
his horse to step into the river and as soon as it did, a furious
current nearly swept it away. It was a miracle that both survived and
<b>reached the other end.</b>

found <b>Bhagmati alive</b> and felt happy after meeting her. After storm

Golconda.</p><p>When Sultan Ibrahim, the <b>father</b> of the young Sultan
heard this <b>tale of dangerous passion</b>,
he was alarmed and forbade Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah from meeting
Bhagmati. Young Sultan was miserable without her. Beautiful women from
Armenia, Persia, Arab and different parts of India were brought to
entertain the prince, <b>but none could attract his attention</b> away from
his beloved 'Bhagmati'.</p><p>Sultan
Ibrahim found that his son loved only Bhagmati and no one else, no
matter how beautiful she was. After seeing so much love for Bhagmati,
Sultan Ibrahim <b>constructed the Purana Pul (Old Bridge)</b> – a massive
stone bridge across the Musi River, to make it easy for the young Sultan to
reach Chichlam to <b>meet his beloved.</b></p><p>The romance of the crown
Prince with a dancer evoked great <b>curiosity and controversy in
Golconda</b>.

The fact that the Bhagmati was a Hindu courtesan and much older than
the prince, created quite a uproar in the court. The orthodox society
was not ready to accept her as queen of Golconda. <b>After ascending the
throne</b>, Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah defied all traditions, <b>married
Bhagmati</b>, and made her his queen. He re-christened her Hyder Mahal, and
<b>named the city Hyderabad in honour of her.</b></p><p></p><center><font

Aurangzeb tried to consolidate his authority over Hyderabad, the city

<p>In 1713, the Mughal Emperor, Farruksiyar, <b>appointed</b> a twenty six

as the new Governor of Deccan. Qamruddin was the grandson of Chin Qilij
Khan, Aurangzeb's brave commander who lost his life during the siege of
Golconda. The young Governor proved to be an able administrator and
earned the title of <b>Nizam-ul-Mulk</b> or the Governor of the
Kingdom.</p><p>In October 1724, Nizam-ul-Mulk declared himself
<i>Subedar</i> or Governor of the <b>six Deccan provinces</b> - Aurangabad,
Bidar, Bijapur, Berar, Adilabad and Hyderabad.</p><p>Between the

Jahis dynasty, the city of Hyderabad steadily deteriorated. Aurangzeb's
only contribution to the city was the <b>completion</b> of the Mecca Masjid
in 1693. In 1763, after a gap of nearly <b>seventy six years</b> Hyderabad
<b>regained</b> its lost glory when Nizam Ali Khan, the second Asaf Jahi
ruler moved the <b>capital back</b> from Aurangabad to Hyderabad.
