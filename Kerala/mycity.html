<p></p><p></p></h3>What makes Hyderabad such a special destination is its
multi-cultural mix of people. <p></p>
<h3>Language</h3>
Hyderabad India
<p>There are four languages in Hyderabad: Hindi, Deccani-Urdu, Telugu and
English. English is the language of business and administration, and is
widely spoken and understood. Most Hyderabadis are bilingual, and speak
their mother tongue as well as English.</p>
<p></p><h3>Religion</h3>With this mixture of people, Hyderabad is also a
mixture of religions.
Hyderabad’s skyline boasts the distinctive minarets of mosques,
intricate figurines of Hindu temple gods, beautiful Churches and
distinctive architecture of Gurudwaras. The main religions are
Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Sikhism.<p></p><p></p>
<h3>Security &amp; Safety</h3>
Hyderabad India
<p>Hyderabad has a well-founded reputation as one of the safest cities in
the world.
Crime rates are very low and the streets are safe to walk in any time
of the day or night. However, I do recommend that visitors to my city
take the normal precaution of keeping their valuables in a safe place
at all times.</p>
<p>The Andhra Pradesh Government has and will continue to
be vigilant in ensuring that Hyderabad remains safe. It has stepped up
security measures at key installations and other sensitive places. The
Government has also made it known that extremism originating from
religion or race has no place in Hyderabad and it will not hesitate to
take action against any extremist or terrorist groups or
individuals.</p><p></p><h3>Wine &amp; Dine</h3>Hyderabad’s 
multicultural population is reflected in the wide variety of excellent
restaurants offering a diversity of cuisine from around the
world.<p></p><h3>Tipping</h3>Tipping
is not encouraged as most hotels and restaurants in Hyderabad already
levy a service charge on customers' bills. Tipping is not a way of life
in Hyderabad and the practice is not
encouraged.<p></p><h3>Driving</h3>Minimum
age is 18 years with a valid state/provincial driver's license. An
international driver's license is required for visits beyond one month.
Cars are right-hand drive; driven on the left-hand side of the road.
<h3>Emergency Numbers</h3>
Hyderabad India
<UL>
<LI>Police 100<LI>Fire 101<LI>Ambulance 102</UL>
<p>These are the numbers in Hyderabad, but they are usually the same in
other cities of India.</p>
<h3>Passport</h3>According
to law, you must have your passport with you at all times. To check
into a hotel you must show your passport to the hotel clerk and fill
out a form with your passport and visa information. If the police ask
to see your passport, you must show it to them. They have the right to
ask you for it at any time, for no reason.
<h3>Electric Current</h3>
Hyderabad India
<p>Standard voltage is 220-240 volts AC 50 cycles per second. Most hotels
are
equipped with transformers for 110-120 volts AC, 60 cycles per second
appliances. This is different from America and England, so to use your
tape recorder, etc., you need a converter and an adapter for your plug,
which you can get at certain Indian appliance stores in your own
country. Socket sizes in India vary, so it is a good idea to get a
universal adapter which is available at airports and at special travel
stores. Sockets have three round pins, which is similar to the ones
used in Europe. European plugs will go into the sockets, but the Indian
pins are a little thicker and the plug will be a little loose, so the
connection may not be so good.</p>
<p><b>NOTICE:</b> There are many power failures in India. So it is a good
idea to have a good flashlight (torch).</p><p></p><h3>Smoking</h3>Smoking
is prohibited in public buses, elevators, theaters, cinemas,
air-conditioned restaurants, shopping centers and government
offices.<p></p><h3>What to Wear</h3>
Hyderabad has a moderate temperature ranging from 15 to 40 degrees.
Light and summer clothing made from natural fabrics like cotton is best
for everyday wear. Casual dress is acceptable for most situations and
occasions but some establishments may require a more formal dress code.
It is always advisable to check beforehand on dress regulations, if
any.<p></p><h3>Acceptable Dress</h3>In
you are well dressed, you will usually be treated better in Hyderabad -
India, especially when you are doing official business. When going to
religious places you should dress very conservatively.
<p></p><h3>Women Travelers</h3>
Hyderabad India
<p>It is best for women not to travel alone, especially if they have never
been to India before. Many men in India think western women to be easy.
Women are often subjected to being stared at, handled, peaked at
through a hole in a hotel room door, and may receive obscene comments.
These situations are not usually a serious threat.</p><p>It is important
that women dress modestly. Women in India do not normally show their
shoulders or knees, or wear tight fitting clothes, or shorts. It is
best not to wear clinging, or low cut clothes. The bra-less look should
be avoided.</p><p>Women usually do not shake hands with men, and
certainly any physical contact beyond this is asking for trouble.
Having a casual conversation with a man is considered a reason for a
man to proceed further. Indian women and men who don’t know each other,
unless they are highly educated, just don’t talk with each other in
India. If you feel that a man is coming into your space, more than
likely he is. Usually you can just request them to stay away from you.
If someone touches you apparently innocently, it usually isn’t. </p><p>If
you have a problem on a train or bus, approach the ticket collector and
ask them politely to help you. If the ticket collector won’t help you,
ask to see the conductor of the train. The conductor is usually a
well-educated man, who you should speak to respectfully, and who will
usually be helpful.Groping is a normal thing. It is standard for women
to be groped (handled) on the local trains. That is why there are
separate compartments for women. Even just walking in the station,
women can be handled. If a woman goes into a very crowded situation
with many men, such as a bus, especially if she is by herself, it is
not unusual for her to be groped. This happens with Indian ladies
too.</p><p>If
you are a woman traveling alone, it could be a good idea to travel by
air-conditioned or first-class. There are much less passengers on these
carriages, and they usually have had more contact with foreigners, so
they are easier to deal with.Women can request a ladies compartment in
a 2nd class carriage of a train. Many trains have such a compartment.
Also, most of the time there is a special ladies’ queue (line) for
purchasing train tickets. This means that ladies can go to the front of
a queue to purchase tickets for trains and no one will say anything.
Most railway stations have ladies’ waiting rooms. </p><p></p>
<h3>Begging</h3>
Hyderabad India
<p>There are beggars, and then there are sadhus or saintly persons who
accept
donations. I do not think it is a good idea to give anything to the
average beggar, unless you give them food. Giving to a saintly person
is actually to the benefit of the giver. The difficulty with giving to
a saintly person is to know who is actually saintly.</p>
<p>One problem about giving to beggars by temples or holy places,
especially if they
are children, is that if you give to one, you may have a hundred
persons surround you and ask you for money. Also, it is a bad policy to
give any money to small children, because they usually give all the
money to their parents or some other adult. In this way the parents do
not have to work, nor is it profitable for the parents to give their
children an education. </p><p></p>
<h3>Indian Culture</h3>
Hyderabad India
<br>
1. Don’t overload your plate, you are expected to finish everything.<br>2.
Never put objects on a temple or someone’s personal altar in their home or
on sacred items, such as a religious book.<br>3. Never point the soles of
your feet towards an altar in a temple, other people, or holy sites.<br>4.
Remove your shoes when entering someone’s home, even if they tell you
it is all right to wear your shoes. It is almost never all right.<br>5.
Don’t take photograph without permission.<p></p><h3>Credit
Cards</h3>American Express, Diners Club, Mastercard and Visa are widely
accepted.
<p></p><h3>Banking &amp; Money Changing </h3>
<p>Hyderabad India</p>
Banks
throughout Hyderabad generally open at 9.30am and close at 3.30pm Mondays
to Fridays, and 9.30am to 12.30am on Saturdays for transactions
of travellers' cheques and other financial matters. For convenience,
Automated teller machines (ATM) are open round-the-clock, offering the
MAESTRO or CIRRUS network system. Apart from the convenience of exchanging
money at all banks and hotels, money can also be exchanged
wherever the sign "Licensed Money Changer" is displayed. Most shopping
complexes have a licensed money changer. Visitors are discouraged from
changing money with unlicensed money changers.
<p></p><h3>Office Hours</h3>Business / government offices are usually open
from Monday to Friday, 9am - 5pm
and Saturday, 9am - 1pm. Offices and shops are usually closed on Sunday,
but can be closed on a different day depending on the town.
<h3>Shopping Hours</h3>
Hyderabad India
<p>Shops open from 10am to 9pm daily. You needn't keep a sharp eye on your
watch
when you're shopping in Hyderabad. Our city also enjoys the reputation of
being one of the safest places to be in, so provided basic
precautions are taken, you can have peace of mind to shop and walk
around well into the night.</p>
is the center of telecommunications in India with 24-hour telex,
international direct dial (IDD) telephone, telegram and facsimile
services. Telephone country code is +91 and city code is 040. There are
many telephone service providers – AirTel, Idea, Reliance, Vodafone and
BSNL. <p></p><h3>Travel and Health Insurance</h3>I strongly recommend
that you take out insurance policies to cover medical and travel
expenses. If necessary, consult your travel agent.<p></p><h3>Drug
Abuse</h3>Drug
abuse is viewed seriously in Hyderabad. Illicit traffic in narcotic
drugs and psychotropic substances is strictly prohibited.
<p></p><h3>Hitech Hyderabad India</h3>Hyderabad is one of the most
<b>developed</b> city in India. It is an emerging information technology
(or IT) and biotechnology hub of India.<p>Hyderabad has witnessed a
remarkable growth in the <b>real estate</b>
business, thanks to a predominantly information technology-driven boom
in the 1990s and the retail industry growth over the last few years
which have spurred hectic commercial activity. A number of mega malls
have come up and are being built in the city.</p><p></p>
<p>The <b>rapid growth</b> of the city, along with the growth of
Secunderabad and neighboring municipalities has resulted in a large
metropolitan area.</p><p>Hyderabad
is the financial and economic capital of the state. The city is the
largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product, state tax
and excise revenues.</p><p>The <b>infrastructural facilities</b> for
basic research in Hyderabad are some of the best in the country,
hosting a large academic population from all over the country and
beyond.</p>
